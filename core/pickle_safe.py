"""Whitelist-based safe pickle unpickler.

Raw ``pickle.loads`` on untrusted input is equivalent to remote code execution:
pickle opcodes can call ``os.system``, ``subprocess.Popen``, ``eval``, or any
other importable callable via ``__reduce__``. This module provides a drop-in
replacement that only resolves classes from a small, pre-approved whitelist
(pure data containers and primitive types) — anything else raises
``pickle.UnpicklingError``.

Intended consumers:
    - ``tools/rpa_unpacker.py``      (RPA archive index reading)
    - ``tools/rpyc_decompiler.py``   (Ren'Py compiled script AST loading)

The Ren'Py-specific behaviour (mapping ``renpy.*`` / ``store.*`` classes to
harmless stubs instead of raising) is kept inside ``rpyc_decompiler.py``
because it requires the stub class hierarchy defined there; this module
stays minimal and reusable.

Pure standard library — no third-party dependencies.
