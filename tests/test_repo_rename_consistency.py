"""Round 51 contract test - GitHub repo rename + logger namespace sync.

Why:
    Round 51 renamed the GitHub repo Renpy-Translator ->
    Multi-Engine-Game-Translator and renamed the project-wide logger
    namespace renpy_translator -> multi_engine_translator (17 sites).
    This test pins the rename so a future commit cannot accidentally
    reintroduce the old names while remaining type/lint-clean.

    It also guards against the inverse failure mode: an over-eager
    sed/grep replacement removing the upstream attribution to
    anonymousException's renpy-translator (MIT, 2024) project, which
    must remain intact in 6 hooks/tools files for license compliance.

How to apply:
    Independent CI step (.github/workflows/test.yml).  Top-level
    ``def test_*`` functions matching the project convention so
    ``scripts/verify_docs_claims.py`` AST counter sees them.
    Stdlib-only.

Round 51 C2 audit closure (Coverage 4 fixes + 1 architectural decision):
    The Round 51 C2 starter audit (3 parallel Explore agents:
    correctness / coverage / security) returned 0/5/0 findings.
    All 4 actionable Coverage findings are closed same-round per
    Round 50's zero-debt closure rule, with explicit additions
    to this file:

      Coverage MEDIUM-1: SKIP_PARTS skip logic for build artifacts
        was implicit only -- closed by
        ``test_skip_parts_excludes_pycache_dir``.
      Coverage MEDIUM-2: ``UPSTREAM_ATTRIBUTION_FILES`` was hand-
        maintained with no inverse exhaustiveness guard -- closed
        by ``test_upstream_attribution_files_list_is_exhaustive``.
      Coverage LOW-1: Self-skip via SELF_PATH worked but was not
        positively verified that the pattern is in fact present in
        this file -- closed by
        ``test_self_skip_contract_pattern_present_in_self``.
      Coverage LOW-2: The CI mock-target guard regex shape (test.yml
        line ~229) had no unit test verifying both forms (string-arg
        + patch.object) and the relaxed file_safety filter -- closed
        by ``test_ci_mock_target_guard_catches_known_stale_forms``.

    Coverage HIGH-1 (no behavioural test that the 17 logger sites emit
    to ``multi_engine_translator``) is reclassified as an architectural
    decision rather than fixed:

      ``logging.getLogger(NAME)`` is a stdlib-level pure identifier
      dispatch -- the namespace is the name, with no derived behaviour
      beyond name equality.  The static orphan grep
      (``test_logger_namespace_renamed_no_orphan_callsites``) plus the
      positive name-string assertion in ``pyproject.toml`` /
      ``HANDOFF.md`` updates already pin the rename completely.  A
      behavioural test would either (a) be tautologically redundant
      with the static contract, or (b) test Python's stdlib rather
      than this project's code.  Adding such a test would lower the
      signal-to-noise ratio of the suite without adding real coverage.
      Documented per Round 50's "unfixable -> architectural decision,
      not debt" policy.
