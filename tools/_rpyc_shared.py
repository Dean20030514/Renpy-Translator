"""Shared constants for the rpyc decompiler's Tier 1 and Tier 2 chains.

Split from ``tools/rpyc_decompiler.py`` in round 40 as the leaf module
both tiers depend on.  Keeping whitelist + format constants here
instead of in one of the tier modules avoids a circular import when
the main module re-exports symbols from Tier 2 at the end.

Round 26 C-3 (originally in the monolithic ``rpyc_decompiler.py``):
the Tier 1 injected helper script and the Tier 2 ``_RestrictedUnpickler``
both use this allowlist to reject classes outside the safe set
— otherwise a malicious .rpyc could smuggle ``os.system`` /
``builtins.eval`` through the pickle ``find_class`` hook.
Co-locating them in this leaf module prevents silent drift.

``_WHITELIST_TIER1_PY2_EXTRAS`` captures the only legitimate
divergence: Ren'Py 7.x ships Python 2.7, which has ``long`` and
``unicode`` as distinct builtins; Tier 2 runs under Python 3 only
and does not need them.
